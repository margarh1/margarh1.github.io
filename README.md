# My Personal Webpage

This project should result in a professional looking webpage that links to my projects and allows me to display the skills that I've learned. It also includes methods by which visitors can reach me, if they are interested in my work or in me.

## Technologies Used

This website is mainly comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, I have used Bootstrap to style my webpage and jQuery to render some of the animations.

## Usage

This webpage includes an "About Me", where I talk about how I got into programming; a "Projects" tab, which displays major projects I'm proud of; a "R&eacute;sum&eacute;" tab, which will take you to a downloadable PDF of my R&eacute;sum&eacute;; and a "Contact" tab, which will indicate the footer at the bottom of the screen where you can contact me. Please click around and explore.

## Contributing

I remain the only contributor to my webpage. Unless opinions count. Also, shout out to my cohort for having really nice portfolio pages, too.

## History

Version 3: This portfolio page has, once again, received a completed overhaul. I've removed all the links to the GitHub repositories, since the vast majority of them are simply practice work, and replaced them with a no-scroll page of tabs instead.

Version 2: The webpage has received a complete overhaul, though it's appearance may not have changed much. I have cleaned up my HTML doc and copied over only what code I need from the CSS and JS files.

Version 1: The webpage was nonexistant before October 25, 2016, so I am not sure what history I am supposed to include here. It started completely blank and now sports links, a background image, and several gray divs containing writing.

## Credits

I still remain the only person to work on this page, though I *have* started asking for input from others.

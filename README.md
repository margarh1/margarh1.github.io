  # ${1:My Personal Webpage}

  This project should result in a professional looking webpage that links to my projects and allows me to display the skills that I've learned. It also includes methods by which visitors can reach me, if they are interested in my work or in me.

  ## Installation

  I am going to assume that by installation process, the instructions mean the development of the website.

  I am using HTML and CSS for the vast majority of the webpage at this moment, though I plan to add Javascript and/or jQuery in the near future.

  ## Usage

  I am not entirely sure what this section is supposed to be, since this project is a webpage. A visitor uses the webpage like any other webpage: by viewing it and possibly clicking on the links, if they are interested.

  ## Contributing

  I am not entirely sure what this section is for either, but am including for possible future reference.

  ## History

  The webpage was nonexistant before October 25, 2016, so I am not sure what history I am supposed to include here. It started completely blank and now sports links, a background image, and several gray divs containing writing.

  ## Credits

  So far, I am the only one who has worked on this page, with little input from others.

  ## Licencse

  I don't think this applies to this project, but since it is in the template, I might as well add it in.

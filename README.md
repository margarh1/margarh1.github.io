# My Personal Webpage

This project should result in a professional looking webpage that links to my projects and allows me to display the skills that I've learned. It also includes methods by which visitors can reach me, if they are interested in my work or in me.

## Technologies Used

This website will mainly be comprised of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Specifically, I have used Bootstrap to style my webpage, Ajax to retrieve my repositories from GitHub, and Handlebars to render them to my page.

## Usage

This webpage can be used to discover what technologies I have learned and what I have learned to do with them.

## Contributing

I am the only contributor to my webpage, as of this update.

## History

Version 2: The webpage has received a complete overhaul, though it's appearance may not have changed much. I have cleaned up my HTML doc and copied over only what code I need from the CSS and JS files.

Version 1: The webpage was nonexistant before October 25, 2016, so I am not sure what history I am supposed to include here. It started completely blank and now sports links, a background image, and several gray divs containing writing.

## Credits

I remain the only person to work on this page, still with little input from others.
